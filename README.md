# Project Logger: A Drizzle + Next.js Demo

**Project Logger** is a modern, type-safe multi-tenant application built with Drizzle ORM, Next.js (App Router), and Supabase (Postgres). It provides a clean, minimalistic interface for creating and managing projects with nested sections, scoped by company.

This app was developed as a learning exercise to explore Drizzle ORM in depth, including schema-first database modeling and type-safe querying. 

I leveraged **Gemini 2.5 Pro** a lot in the development process and to experiment with design patterns and assist with debugging migrations.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js `v18+`
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) account

---

### 2. Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/timsinashok/Project-Logger.git
cd Project-Logger
npm install
````

---

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Copy  .env file in the root directory:


In your Supabase dashboard, go to **Project Settings â†’ Database**, and copy the connection string (URI format). Paste it in `.env.local` like so:

```env
# .env
DATABASE_URL="postgres://..."
```

---

### 4. Push the Database Schema

This will sync the schema from `schema.ts` to your Supabase DB:

```bash
npx drizzle-kit push
```

---

### 5. Seed the Database

To insert some starter data (e.g., sample users like "alice" and "bob"):

```bash
npm run drizzle:seed
```

---

### 6. Run the App

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and log in with any username to begin.
